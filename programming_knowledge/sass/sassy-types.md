# Sass(y) Types

There are different data types you can assign to a variable in CSS.

In addition to the color data type we have seen, there are also:

- Numbers, such as `8.11`, `12`, and `10px`. Notice that while `10` has a unit of `px` associated with it, it is still considered a number.

- Strings of text, with and without quotes. Some examples are `"potato"`, `'tomato'`, `span`.

- Booleans, or simply `true` and `false`.

- null, which is considered an empty value.
