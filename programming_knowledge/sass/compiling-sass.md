# Compiling Sass

Sass can’t be directly interpreted by your browser, so it must first be converted, or compiled, to CSS before the browser can directly understand it.

Compiling refers to converting code to lower level code so that it can be executed. By compiling SCSS to CSS, it can be interpreted by your browser and the results will appear on a webpage.

Before we dive into writing Sass, let’s first learn how to compile it to CSS by typing the following command in the terminal and pressing enter:

```bash
sass main.scss main.css
```

The `sass` command above takes in two arguments:

The input (main.scss)
The location of where to place that output (main.css)
Make sure to look closely at the extensions of each file in the command above.
